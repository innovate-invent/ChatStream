<h2>YouTube API Services</h2>
<p>ChatStream utilizes the YouTube API Services to retrieve your YouTube Live Broadcast data, specifically your user ID,
    live chat ID, Google OAuth token, and chat activity. This data is processed and stored locally in your browser and
    is
    utilized for the sole purpose of presenting chat activity to the end user. ChatStream attempts to
    automatically renew your Google OAuth token for the sole purpose of accessing YouTube API Services on your behalf.
    ChatStream does not transmit or share any of the YouTube related data to anyone other than YouTube API Services. The
    YouTube API may store, access or collect information directly or indirectly on or from users’ devices, including
    by placing, accessing or recognizing cookies or similar technology on users' devices or browsers. Cookies and
    similar technologies are used to enhance the user experience, monitor performance, and deliver relevant content.
    These technologies may collect information such as IP address, browser type, and usage behavior. YouTube complies
    with all relevant data protection standards. ChatStream itself does not utilize cookies or similar technologies.</p>
<p>You can revoke ChatStreams access to your YouTube account at any time via <a
        href="https://security.google.com/settings/">Google Security settings</a> or directly at <a
