<p>ChatStream is an OBS Studio overlay that provides streamers and content creators a means of integrating their viewers
    real time chat directly into the video stream. This provides viewers with an added level of interactivity with the
    stream content. It is a client application that directly accesses the streaming platforms API via the streamers
    OAuth credentials.</p>
<p>ChatStream combines Twitch, Youtube, and Discord chats into a single stream. It can be embedded into a video stream
    via OBS Browser Source or used on its own. It provides a basic TTS system when selecting a chat message.</p>
<p>ChatStream stores all credentials and information client side. Nothing is transmitted to our servers.</p>
<p>Please report issues to <a href="https://github.com/innovate-invent/ChatStream/issues">https://github.com/innovate-invent/ChatStream/issues</a>
</p>

<p>To begin, paste the following URL into a OBS browser source:
    <a href="https://chatstream.i2labs.ca/chat.html#twitch&youtube&discordChannel=">https://chatstream.i2labs.ca/chat.html#twitch&#38;youtube&#38;discordChannel=</a>.
    If you don't want to always use the most recent changes you can use an <a href="versions.html">older version here</a>.
</p>
<p>To disable automatic login of a platform, simply remove it from the URL fragment list (including the "&amp;"
    prefix).</p>
<p>To log in, right click the browser source and click "Interact". Within the interactive view you can right-click to
    pull up a menu to manually log into the different platforms.
    <em>Do not do this while your stream is active or viewers will be able to see your login credentials.</em>
    If the login prompt won't scroll, temporarily remove the
    CSS from the OBS Browser Source configuration as it disables scrolling by default. Alternatively, use keyboard
    navigation by pressing tab until you move to the required page element.</p>

<p><a href="tos.html">License, Terms of Service, &amp; Privacy Policy</a></p>

<p>To <a href="https://chatstream.i2labs.ca/chat.html#demo">test the chat overlay</a> you can add <code>&demo</code> to
    the
    URL fragment to start a dummy chat source. It randomly posts messages within a time range. To customise the time
    range specify <code>&amp;demo=2000</code> setting the number to any positive integer representing the maximum
    milliseconds between messages.</p>

<p>The chat will scroll automatically at a set rate. If more messages are being sent than can be shown, the scroll speed
    will linearly speed up to try and catch up. This can be customised by setting <code>&amp;speed=10</code> in the URL
    fragment with any positive integer. To disable this and always show the most recent message when it is received, set
    <code>&amp;speed=0</code>.</p>

<p>To customise the colors of the overlay you can add CSS to the OBS Browser Source configuration.</p>
<p>For example: <code>body { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); margin: 0px auto; color: gray;
    font-size: 24px; }</code></p>
<p>Further customisation can be done with an assortment of CSS selectors:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>#chat</code> will target the direct parent of all chat messages</li>
    <li><code>[data-source=youtube]</code> will target a message from a specific platform (twitch, youtube, discord)
    </li>
    <li><code>.username</code> targets the user name field of each message</li>
    <li><code>.username:before</code> contains the platform Font Awesome 6 Brands character code</li>
    <li><code>.message</code> targets the text field of each message</li>
    <li>A convenience CSS parameter is provided to simplify
        setting the message line limit: <code>#chat { --message-line-limit: 2; }</code>. Include <code>#chat li {
            word-break: normal; }</code> to make sentences break normally.
    </li>
    <li>When <code>&amp;speed</code> is greater than 0, messages are tagged with <code>.old</code> after a set time that
        roughly would coincide with the message scrolling off screen in a busy chat room.
    </li>
    <li>New messages are tagged with <code>.new</code> and then the class is removed one tick later to trigger CSS
        transitions. Use this to specify the initial CSS state of a message. Specify
        <code>--message-transition-duration</code> to change the default duration.
    </li>
    <li>Set <code>#chat { --name-luminance: 70%; }</code> to change the luminance value of the usernames.</li>
    <li>The <code>--namehash</code> CSS variable is set for each username that is a simple hash of the first and last
        character of the username. This provides a stable hue value between 0 and 360 based on the name to pick a
        distinct color for each user.
        Set <code>#chat .username { color: hsl(var(--namehash) 100% var(--name-luminance)); }</code> to customise the
        color.
    </li>
</ul>


<h1>Speech Synth</h1>
<p>ChatStream supports basic speech synthesis by clicking on a message to be read in the OBS Interactive view.</p>
<p>Speech synthesis depends on the standard <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">Web Speech API</a> built into the
    browser. It offers a few customisation options:</p>
<label style="display: block">Voice:
    <select id="selectedLanguage" style="display: inline-block"></select>
    <select id="selectedVoice" style="display: inline-block"></select><span> (If this is empty then you need to launch Chrome or OBS with
        "--enable-speech-dispatcher" command line argument. The Flatpak distribution of OBS does not support this.)
    </span></label>
<label>Pitch: <input id="pitch" type="number" min="0" max="2" step="0.01"></label>
<label>Rate: <input id="rate" type="number" min="0.1" max="10" step="0.1"></label>
<button id="testSpeech">Test</button>
<script type="module">
    import {speak} from "./tts.js";

    testSpeech.addEventListener('click', () => speak('Testing the Web Speech API, speech synthesis system..'));

    function populateVoices() {
        const langs = new Set();
        const currentLang = selectedLanguage.value || localStorage.getItem('synthLang');
        const currentVoice = selectedVoice.value || localStorage.getItem('synthVoice');
        pitch.value = localStorage.getItem('synthPitch') || 1;
        rate.value = localStorage.getItem('synthRate') || 1;
        selectedVoice.replaceChildren(...speechSynthesis.getVoices().filter(voice => {
            langs.add(voice.lang);
            return currentVoice === voice.voiceURI || voice.lang === currentLang;
        }).map(voice => {
            const option = document.createElement('option');
            // The speech server seems to prefix each option with the language
            option.textContent = voice.name.replace(/^.*\+/, '');
            option.setAttribute("value", voice.voiceURI);
            if (voice.voiceURI === currentVoice) option.setAttribute("selected", "true");
            return option;
        }));
        selectedLanguage.replaceChildren(...Array.from(langs).sort().map(l => {
            const option = document.createElement('option');
            option.textContent = l;
            option.setAttribute('value', l);
            if (l === currentLang) option.setAttribute("selected", "true");
            return option;
        }));
        selectedLanguage.value = currentLang;
        selectedVoice.value = currentVoice;
    }

    populateVoices();
    speechSynthesis.addEventListener('voiceschanged', populateVoices);
    selectedLanguage.addEventListener('change', populateVoices);
    pitch.addEventListener('change', () => {
        if (pitch.value >= 0 && pitch.value <= 2) localStorage.setItem('synthPitch', pitch.value);
    });
    rate.addEventListener('change', () => {
        if (rate.value >= 0.1 && rate.value <= 10) localStorage.setItem('synthRate', rate.value);
    });
    selectedVoice.addEventListener('change', () => {
        localStorage.setItem('synthVoice', selectedVoice.value);
        localStorage.setItem('synthLang', selectedLanguage.value);
    });

<h1>Twitch</h1>
<p>You will be automatically redirected to authenticate with Twitch. The user account that is used will
    automatically decide the primary streams chat.</p>

<h2>Twitch TOS</h2>
<p>Twitch <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/simulcasting-guidelines?language=en_US">prohibits</a> embedding chat
    from third parties, this means you need to use one of two workarounds:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Assuming you are using the <a
                href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/multiple-rtmp-outputs-plugin.964/">Multiple RTMP outputs
            plugin</a>, create a separate OBS Scene with a separate ChatStream overlay configuration that only shows
            Twitch chat. In the "Multiple RTMP outputs" panel edit your Twitch target, change the encoder to something
            appropriate (x264 is the default) and select the Scene you set up with the Twitch specific chat overlay.</p>
        <p>You can attain limited scene switching capability using OBSs scene nesting capability. Start by creating
            three scenes, one for Twitch with the Twitch specific overlay, one for the other platforms with their
            configured chat overlay, and one to control the active scene. Add the control scene to the chat overlay
            scenes, and add all your desired scenes to the control scene. Then control the "active" scene by hiding and
            showing the scenes nested within the control scene.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If you need full featured scene switching for Twitch then you will need to run three separate instances of
            OBS. A primary instance that does all the scene switching and primary compositing. This will only run a
            virtual camera output. The two other instances will take the virtual camera input and overlay ChatStream,
            one with the Twitch restriction and the other with no chat restrictions.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h1>Youtube</h1>
<p>You will be automatically redirected to authenticate with Youtube. The user account that is used will
    automatically decide the primary streams chat.</p>

<p>If you have multiple broadcasts, you may need to set <code>&youtubeBroadcastIndex=1</code> (or a higher number)
    in the URL to get the correct chat stream.</p>

<h1>Discord</h1>
<p>Discord does not currently permit anything except a bot token to access its Gateway API. This means you need to
    create your own bot and provide the bot token.</p>
<p><code>&amp;discordChannel=[channel id]</code> must be provided. To get your channel ID, right-click on the channel in
    the Discord client and click "Copy Link". This will provide you with a URL of the format:
    <code>https://discord.com/channels/[guild-server id]/[channel id]</code>.</p>

<h2>Creating a bot token</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Browse to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Developer Portal</a></li>
    <li>Click "New Application"</li>
    <li>Name it anything (this name will be visible) and confirm the prompts</li>
    <li>Paste your Application ID here to store in the browsers LocalStorage to avoid exposing it in the fragment
        parameters:
        <input type="text" oninput="localStorage.setItem('discordAppID', this.value)"></li>
    <li>Browse to the "Installation" section on the left of the dashboard</li>
    <li>Change "Install Link" to None</li>
    <li>Click "Save Changes" on the pop-up</li>
    <li>Browse to the "Bot" section on the left of the dashboard</li>
    <li>Click "Reset Token" to generate a Bot Token</li>
    <li>Paste your bot token here to store in the browsers LocalStorage to avoid exposing it in the fragment parameters:
        <input type="text" oninput="localStorage.setItem('discordBotToken', this.value)"></li>
    <li>Disable "Public Bot"</li>
    <li>Enable "Message Content Intent"</li>
    <li>Click "Save Changes" on the pop-up</li>
    <li>Browse to the "OAuth2" section on the left of the dashboard</li>
    <li>In the "OAuth2 URL Generator" select only "bot"</li>
    <li>Scroll down to "Integration Type" and select "Guild Install"</li>
    <li>Browse to the generated URL and follow the prompts to add the bot to your Discord Server/Guild</li>
    <li>Done.</li>
</ol>
