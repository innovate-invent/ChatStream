# ChatStream OBS chat overlay

ChatStream is an OBS Studio overlay that provides streamers and content creators a means of integrating their viewers
real time chat directly into the video stream. This provides viewers with an added level of interactivity with the
stream content. It is a client application that directly accesses the streaming platforms API via the streamers OAuth
credentials.

ChatStream combines Twitch, Youtube, and Discord chats into a single stream. It can be embedded into a video stream 
via OBS Browser Source or used on its own. It provides a basic TTS system when selecting a chat message.
